# ImportHS6e
Character sheet import tool for Roll20. Imports Hero System 6e sheets to the Hero6e character sheet.

This sheet is recommended to be used with the other non-official Hero System API's (HeroSystem6e and HeroTracker).

You can install the API's for HeroSystem6e and HeroTracker applications via the one click install. My importer will be there once I have it working and ready for production. Here is a link that covers the one click installs:
